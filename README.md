1. Counting Dittos
- Implemented a Ditto Pokémon counting system utilizing computer vision techniques, including adaptive thresholding, morphological operations, and color segmentation in the HSV color space. The algorithm accurately identifies and counts Ditto Pokémon instances in images, comparing the results with expected counts and calculating the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for evaluation.

2. Car crashes in a video
- Developed a car counting system using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) with Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features for vehicle detection in videos. The algorithm accurately identifies and counts cars, with results compared to expected values, and the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) is used for evaluation.

3. Recognizing simple CAPTCHA
- Developed a CAPTCHA recognition system utilizing image processing techniques (cropping, grayscale conversion, binarization) and a Keras-based neural network for Latin letter (and special characters like Ž, Č...) recognition. Implemented K-Means clustering to assess spatial distances for improved accuracy.
